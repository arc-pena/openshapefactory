// The arithmetic behind the Flow package and nothing else: no DOM, no
// OpenCascade, no interface. A floor plate goes in as a grid of walkable and

// later, and how crowded it got.
//
// WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS THESE ARE. This is a SIMULATION, and a simulation is a
// model with its assumptions written down rather than a measurement. Two of the
// assumptions are published and named, and the rest are stated:
//
//   Weidmann's speed-density relation - how much a crowd slows itself down.
//     v = v0 (1 - exp(-1.913 (1/rho - 1/5.4))), rho in people per square metre,
//     free speed 1.34 m/s. It is the standard fundamental diagram of pedestrian
//     traffic and it is why a corridor has a capacity at all.
//
//   Fruin's Level of Service - the A to F bands every workplace report quotes,
//     as area per person on a walkway. Not a comfort opinion: the thresholds
//     are where overtaking stops being possible, then where choosing your own
//     speed stops being possible, and so on down.
//
//   Everything else - how people steer round each other, how they pick a door -
//     is a steering model, tuned to look right. It reproduces the queues, the
//     lane forming and the pinch points that make these studies worth doing. It
//     does not predict what one particular person will do, and no simulation
//     does.
//
// So: the geometry is exact, the capacity is published, the behaviour is a
// model. Say which is which on screen, and never let a smooth animation imply
// a precision that is not there.

// The even-odd crossing test is the sketcher's, not a second copy of it: a
// point is inside a ring or it is not, and two answers to that would be one
// answer too many.

   does twenty sweeps of the same grid. Measured on this machine, four fields
   over a quarter of a million cells is about 170 ms - fast enough to run while

     OCCUPANCY  how long people were here. Person-seconds per square metre.

                Bright where a corridor is busy and brighter where anybody
                stops.

   A busy corridor is hot on both. A lift lobby that everybody crosses and
   nobody stays in is hot on footfall and cold on occupancy. A desk cluster is
   the other way round. Showing one and calling it "the heatmap" is how a
