// The Flow package.
//
// A workplace consultant's question is never "does it fit". It is "what
// happens when three hundred people try to use it at once", and the honest
// answer to that has always needed either a simulation or a building. This is
// the simulation, over the plan you are drawing, updating while you drag.
//
// The trick that makes it live is one field. Rather than finding a route per
// person per frame, ONE sweep out from the destinations gives every cell its
// distance to the nearest one, and everybody walks downhill on it. Move a desk
// and it is a single sweep to re-route the whole floor - which is why this can
// run as an overlay on the model rather than as a job you submit.
//
// WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS THESE ARE. The plan is exact: obstacles come from the
// model, cut at a height you choose. The capacity is published - Weidmann's
// speed-density relation and Fruin's Levels of Service, both named on screen.
// The behaviour is a MODEL: how people steer round each other is tuned to look
// right, and it reproduces the queues, the lanes and the pinch points that make
// these studies worth doing. It does not predict what any one person will do.
// Read it for where the plan fails, not for a headcount at a moment.

/* ================================================================= walking

   The mesh is king.

   What people can walk on is not an outline rasterised into a bitmap - it is
   the triangles of the model, filtered. Three things about a triangle decide
   it: which way it faces (up, or it is a ceiling), how steep it is (past about
   1:8 you are climbing), and whether anything stands in the headroom over it.
   That is the whole test, and it is the same test on a flat office floor, a
   ramp, a stepped terrace and the transition of a skate bowl.

   The grid is still a grid, because a quarter of a million Dijkstra cells in
   170 ms is what makes the thing interactive - but every cell now carries the
   HEIGHT of the surface under it, taken from the triangles. So a cell with no
   walkable triangle over it has no floor at all, which is what a void is, and
   a person's feet are at the height of the surface they are standing on rather
   than at one number for the whole plate.
