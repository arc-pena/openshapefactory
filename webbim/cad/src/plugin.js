// Packages.
//
// The modeller is one page, and one page has a budget: the tools on the rail,
// the types in the catalogue, the words in the assistant's briefing. Everything
// that could be there costs something for everyone who does not want it, so
// what is not general goes in a package and a package is off until it is asked
// for.
//
// A package DECLARES itself before it does anything. That declaration is the
// whole contract, and it is deliberately the same shape as the ones the kernel
// already publishes - the catalogue of nodes, the manifest of factory
// operations - because there is then only one thing to read:
//
//     what it is        an id, a name, a sentence
//     what it adds      nodes, an API, a view, resources
//     what it needs     other packages, and what it will not run without
//     how to start it   one function, handed a kit
//
// Nothing in the declaration runs. It is data, it is cheap, and it is readable
// with the package switched off - which is what lets the settings menu list
// what is available, and lets the assistant be told "there is a Climate package
// you could ask for" without paying for it in every prompt.
//
// What loading actually saves. In a single-file page every byte is in the file
// whether a package is loaded or not, and it would be dishonest to pretend
// otherwise. What loading changes is real all the same:
//
//   - a package's DATA rides gzipped in its own script element and is unpacked
//     only on load, so a session that never opens it never pays the memory or
//     the time;
//   - its drivers, buffers and views are only built on load;
//   - its nodes are not in the catalogue, on the rail, or in the assistant's
//     briefing until then - so the interface and the prompt stay the size of
//     what you are actually using.
